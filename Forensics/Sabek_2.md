# Solution 

From Sabek 1, we know that the target is _192.168.0.37_ and the hacker is _192.168.0.31_. So I filtred all http request like: `http && ip.src ==192.168.0.31`

So look at the packets, I noticed that, he/she try to list a directory content with `dir` cmd

The path for this vuln is **/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/advanced-custom-fields-pro/acf.php?cmd=dir**

And the type of the vuln in [RCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCE_-_Remote_Code_Execution), so our flag is there...

**FLAG**: acdfCTF{RCE-/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/advanced-custom-fields-pro/acf.php?cmd=dir}
