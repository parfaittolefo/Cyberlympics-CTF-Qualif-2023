# Solution 

To quickly solve this challenge, you need to know the basics of the [attack execution process](https://www.information-age.com/7-steps-hackers-take-execute-successful-cyber-attack-745/).
The first steps are **Reconnaissance** and **Scanning**. To know more about, ask your friend [google](google.com) or [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)
This mean we shoul look at from wich IP coming many request to wich one ...
The first is the attacker and the second is the target.

Look at a packet I noticed that `192.168.0.37` is a web server. So our hacker may be `192.168.0.21`

Looking for some conversation from the web server I found this.

This mean that its OS is **Windows Operation System** 

Let's try our flag... acdfCTF{192.168.0.21&Windows_Operating_System} 

wath ??? Wrong üôÅ

Try the second IP: acdfCTF{192.168.0.31&Windows_Operating_System} 

Correct ‚úÖ

**FLAG**: acdfCTF{192.168.0.31&Windows_Operating_System}
