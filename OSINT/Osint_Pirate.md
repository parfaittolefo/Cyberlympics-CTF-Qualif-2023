Zooming in closely on the image, we noticed the inscription "TREASURES" on the ship.

This indication allowed us to identify the vessel under the name “TREASURES”. However, we then did a Google search to find information on the year the ship "TREASURES" was built. This search led us to several websites dealing with MS TREASURES, and among these many sites, the site https://www.viva-riverside.city/en/ships/ms-treasures turned out to be the most comprehensive, providing several information on this liner.
