For this challenge, we used Yandex to perform an image search.
Yandex informed us that the image depicted Coney Island. However, we have submitted the format
of the flag to the GPT-3 artificial intelligence and asked it to provide us with an answer in
using the format of the flag as well as all the information she had about the location of the Coney Island location.
This approach allowed us to obtain the flag.
