**Challenge:** CodeX

**Pts:** 100

**Description**

I'm almost there to create the perfect recipe, but a crucial ingredient is missing. Can you discover the secret ingredient? Once you do, I'll gladly share my perfect recipe with you.

Flag Format: acdfCTF{}

File: [**recipe**](https://github.com/parfaittolefo/Cyberlympics-CTF-Qualif-2023/raw/main/chal_files/recipe)


# Solution

I used an online tool for decompilation. The tool is **dogbolt** (https://dogbolt.org/). On dogbolt, decompiling with binary ninja and Hex-Rays directly displays the inverse of the flag, but ghidra displays it in hex.
